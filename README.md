# Ping Game

A fun two-player dice game built with JavaScript, where players take turns rolling a die to accumulate points. Strategy comes into play as players must decide whether to "hold" their points or risk rolling again and potentially losing their turn's score. Built as part of Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course.

## Game Rules

1. Each turn, a player can roll a die as many times as they wish
2. Each roll gets added to their CURRENT score
3. If a player rolls a 1, they lose their CURRENT score and it's the next player's turn
4. A player can choose to 'Hold', which adds their CURRENT score to their TOTAL score
5. The first player to reach 100 points (TOTAL score) wins the game
